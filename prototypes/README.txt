This directory contains python prototypes
suitable for constructing a variety of 
useful WFST models.

silclass2fst.py 
  - Build a silence class model from a wordlist

arpa2fst.py 
  - Build a WFST from a standard ARPA-format N-gram model
    NOTE: The python prototype ignores missing backoff nodes.
          These generally only occur in large interpolated or 
          heavily pruned models and even then seem to make
          little difference to WER.  Probably not important, 
          but the C++ versions handle this issue.

lexicon2fst.py
  - Build a pronunciation lexicon WFST from a pronunciation dictionary.
    Input should be one entry per line, 
    ----------------
      WORD\tw er d 
    ----------------
  - Only builds the simplest generic lexicon.  C++ version includes 
    a variety of additional options.

cd2fst.py 
  - Build a context dependency transducer from a monophone list, an
    auxiliary symbols list (both generated by lexicon2fst.py) and an
    HTK format tiedlist to map logical->physical triphones
